### Introduction to Scrum

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. Scrum co-creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland have written The Scrum Guide to explain Scrum clearly and succinctly.  This Guide contains the definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrum’s accountabilities, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. 

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:
- A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.

### 1.Introduction to SEO

SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, it means the process of improving your site to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business in Google, Bing, and other search engines. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.

SEO is a fundamental part of digital marketing because people conduct trillions of searches every year, often with commercial intent to find information about products and services. Search is often the primary source of digital traffic for brands and complements other marketing channels. Greater visibility and ranking higher in search results than your competition can have a material impact on your bottom line.

However, the search results have been evolving over the past few years to give users more direct answers and information that is more likely to keep users on the results page instead of driving them to other websites.

Also note, features like rich results and Knowledge Panels in the search results can increase visibility and provide users more information about your company directly in the results.

In sum, SEO is the foundation of a holistic marketing ecosystem. When you understand what your website users want, you can then implement that knowledge across your campaigns (paid and organic), across your website, across your social media properties, and more.

### 2.Introduction to GTM

Google Tag Manager is a tag management system that includes the same functionality as global site tags, and lets you configure and instantly deploy tags on your website or mobile app from an easy to use web-based user interface. In addition, Tag Manager features support for tag organization and version control, 3rd party and community-developed tag templates, and enterprise collaboration and security features.
Tag Manager helps to optimize tag deployment, reduce tag configuration errors and allows you to modify and deploy tags on your site instantly from a web-based interface.


### 3. Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

**23th feb to 24th feb**

### Introduction to Javascript

JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

 **21th mar to 1st apr**
 
 
 ## Database Composition:
 
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43844898/170986798-24d7002b-755d-4364-8d0e-3268e88b2916.png)

 
 ## Database Environment :
 
- Development Database : This DB is completely dedicated to developers where they can perform all database related activities except DDL commands and DBA activities.    Developers can compile all DB objects and make any DML operations here.

- Read Only Database : Copy of production database  storing  over-night data. No DML commands are possible here as the name suggests its open for read only access. It is generally used for reporting, verification purpose and data extractions.

- Production Database : All live modules are running on this database. Keep live data , no one has direct access on this database except database team .
 
 ## DBA Responsibilities 

- Installing and upgrading the required database technology and application tools
- Allocating system storage and planning future storage requirements for the database system
- Creating primary database storage structures (tablespaces) after application developers have designed an application
- Creation and modification of all required DB objects (tables, views, indexes etc) after confirmation from DBCR panel.
- Controlling and monitoring user access to the database.
- Monitoring and optimizing the performance of the database.
- Backing up and restoring the database.
 

 **4 apr to 8 apr**
 
 ## Data retrieval and granting access
 
For working on databases we installed various software like sql developer for oracle work, pgadmin for postgreSQL and mtputty for sudo access and command line use.
For managing our project or tickets we used openproject software.Each languages have various database like:
- For oracle : meshr and reportdb
- For postgreSQL : Enquirydb,Imbuyreq,Approvalpg
- MySQL : Tender
- For Cassandra - Trade, FCP, SELLERS.IM, MY, SOA, Clickstream, Mobile, MDC, TDW, CWS.
- For Neo4j - Fraud Detection
 
We also studied about structure of various databases.We also learn about to retrieve huge data and share and giving access to other users in different teams.Sometimes we faced problem regarding sharing of huge data in crores.Then we learn how to create table on other database and access data through database linking.Then we give access to other teams so that they can access that.
For instance, meshr contains most of the old indiamart data.In case a team requires huge amount of data from meshr.Then it cannot be provided directly.For this purpose we use reportdb,where we accumulate all the required data and grant access according to the departments.
 
 
 **11 apr to 15 apr**
 
 ## Query Optimization
 
 Data is integral part of any application.Access to the data should be in the fastest way possible to enhance user experience while using the application.We learn before making any query we try to follow various things:
- Not applying joins unless it is not important.
- Applying where clause to restrict data.
- FROM and JOIN: The FROM clause, and subsequent JOINs are 
first executed to determine the total working set of data that is 
being queried 
- WHERE: Once we have the total working set of data, the 
WHERE constraints are applied to the individual rows, and 
rows that do not satisfy the constraint are discarded. 
- GROUP BY: The remaining rows after the WHERE constraints 
are applied are then grouped based on common values in the 
column specified in the GROUP BY clause.  
 HAVING: If the query has a GROUP BY clause, then the 
constraints in the HAVING clause are applied to the grouped 
rows 
- SELECT: Any expressions in the SELECT part of the query are 
finally computed. 
- DISTINCT: Of the remaining rows. 
- ORDER BY: If an order is specified by the ORDER BY clause, 
the rows are then sorted by the specified data . 
- LIMIT: Finally, the rows that fall outside the range specified by 
the LIMIT are discarded, leaving the final set of rows to be 
returned from the query.  
 
 
 
 **18 apr to 22 apr**
 
 ## Load Monitoring Tools
 
 - Shinken : It is used to monitor all the databases of indiamart.We can check alerts on various servers.It tells us whether particular server is critical,normal and warning.Three types of alert is there:
 Normal: It means that server is working fine.
 Warning : It means that server is giving downtime take action within duration.
 Crtical : It means that server is on high alert take action as soon as possible.
 
- Zabbix : It gives us summary about server load in the form of graphs.We can check summary of load on servers in various duration like weekly,monthly and yearly.
 Data ranging from last two years to last 5 mins and anything in between.
